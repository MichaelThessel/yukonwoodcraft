This project entailed building a vanity for a daycare. The vanity is a scaled
down version of a regular vanity. It features a step to allow the kids to use
the sink comfortably (due to the way the plumbing in the building was set up it was
not possible to lower the vanity even further). The doors of the vanity feature
3D printed decals to fit into a daycare environment.
