This project entailed creating a shelf feature that wrapped around most of the exterior walls of an office. I worked closely with the client to come up with a design. The idea was to have something that is a visual feature while still being light and unobtrusive. The shelves also needed to match the existing maple furniture that was already in place. Mounting was done with a french cleat system which allows to hide the mounting hardware completely.
