For this project a multi-mode couch table was designed and built. The table is made
from solid birch wood. The tapered legs are attached via hand cut joinery. The table
can be used in 2 different ways. First in a regular horizontal way and secondly in a vertical
position where the legs slide under the couch offering a surface to place i.e.
drinks.
